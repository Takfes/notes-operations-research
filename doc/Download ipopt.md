I apologize for the oversight. Here's how you can install `Ipopt` for use with `Pyomo` on a Mac:

1. **Install Homebrew if not already installed**:
   If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Ipopt using Homebrew**:
   In the terminal, run:

   ```bash
   brew install ipopt
   ```

3. **Install additional Python bindings (optional)**:
   If you need the Python bindings for Ipopt, you can install them via `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install cyipopt
   ```

4. **Verify the Installation**:
   To ensure that Ipopt is installed correctly, you can try running:
   ```bash
   ipopt
   ```
   This should display the Ipopt command-line options.

Now, with `Ipopt` installed, you can use it with `Pyomo` by specifying the solver name as 'ipopt' when solving a model.

Note: If you face any issues with the solver's shared libraries, you might need to set your `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the directory where the Ipopt libraries are located.
