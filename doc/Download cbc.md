To use the CBC solver with Pyomo in Python, you'll need to first download and install CBC, and then integrate it with Pyomo. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you:

1. **Installing Pyomo**:
   If you haven't installed Pyomo yet, you can do so via pip:

   ```
   pip install pyomo
   ```

2. **Downloading and Installing CBC**:

   **For Windows**:

   - Visit the [Bintray repository](https://bintray.com/coin-or/download/Cbc) for COIN-OR.
   - Download the latest CBC binary for Windows.
   - Extract the zip file and ensure that the directory containing the `cbc.exe` file is added to your system's PATH.

   **For MacOS**:

   - If you have Homebrew installed, you can simply run:
     ```
     brew install coin-or-tools/coinor/cbc
     ```

   **For Linux**:

   - On Ubuntu/Debian-based distributions, you can use:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install coinor-cbc
     ```

3. **Using CBC with Pyomo**:

   Once CBC is installed and available in your system's PATH, you can use it as a solver in Pyomo like this:

   ```python
   from pyomo.environ import *

   model = ConcreteModel()
   # Define your model here

   # Using the CBC solver
   solver = SolverFactory('cbc')
   results = solver.solve(model)
   ```

Remember, for the CBC solver to work with Pyomo, `cbc` must be callable from the command line. You can test this by simply typing `cbc` in your command prompt or terminal. If it's set up correctly, you shouldn't see any errors. If there are issues, ensure that the directory containing the CBC executable is properly added to your system's PATH.
